description: Implement a feature enhancement for the NoteApp project starting from any Jira issue key in the SCRUM project (SCRUM-1, SCRUM-42, SCRUM-<any number>, etc.) or a jira link like https://sandeep12biswas.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-<number>. Fetches and summarizes the story, gets explicit user confirmation before writing any code, implements the change following this repo's architecture rules, and finishes by writing/running unit tests. Use this whenever the user says things like "implement SCRUM-12", "work on this jira ticket", "pick up the story at <jira link>", or "start the enhancement for <issue key>" — not for bug fixes with no Jira ticket, and not for ad-hoc requests that don't reference a Jira issue.

# Feature Enhancement (Jira-driven)

Turns a Jira story into a reviewed, tested code change for this repo. The whole point of
this skill is the confirmation gate in step 3: never start editing code before the user has
seen a plain-language summary of what the ticket is asking for and explicitly said to proceed.
Stories get reworded, mis-scoped, or contain assumptions that don't fit this codebase — catching
that *before* writing code is cheaper than catching it after.

## Input

The user gives a Jira issue key $SCRUM# (`SCRUM-<number>` — any number, this isn't limited to a specific
issue) or a full issue URL (`https://sandeep12biswas.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-<number>`). If
neither is present in the request, ask for it before doing anything else — don't guess an issue
key, and don't assume it's always the same one from a previous run of this skill.

Extract the key from a URL with the pattern `/browse/([A-Z]+-\d+)`; otherwise the input is
already the key. This pattern matches any project prefix, not just SCRUM, in case the site ever
has more than one project.

Optionally, the user may also supply a git branch name to build on (e.g. "implement SCRUM-23 off
feature/working-app-V2"). If given, that's the **base branch** the new feature branch gets created
from in Step 4. If not given, the base branch defaults to `develop` — don't ask unless the request is
genuinely ambiguous about which existing branch it relates to.

## Step 1 — Fetch the issue

1. Resolve `cloudId`: try the site hostname (`sandeep12biswas.atlassian.net`) directly as
   `cloudId` first. If that fails, call `mcp__atlassian__getAccessibleAtlassianResources` and use
   the returned `id`.
2. Call `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` with the resolved `cloudId`, the issue key, and
   `fields: ["summary","description","status","issuetype","priority","labels","components","assignee","reporter"]`.
3. If the issue has linked sub-tasks or an epic that materially changes scope, it's fine to
   fetch those too, but don't go spelunking through the whole project — one issue is the unit of
   work here.
4. Change the jira status from 'TODO' to 'In Progress' 

If the issue can't be found (bad key, no access), say so plainly and stop — don't fall back to
inventing requirements.

## Step 2 — Summarize

Present a short, plain-language summary before anything else — no code, no file exploration
beyond what's needed to sanity-check feasibility. Cover:

- **What's being asked**, in your own words (don't just paste the Jira description back).
- **Where it likely lands** in this codebase's layers (`app/ui`, `app/controllers`,
  `app/repositories`, `app/models`, `app/db`, etc.) — see the architecture section of
  `CLAUDE.md`. This is a quick read of the ticket against the layering, not a full design doc.
- **Anything ambiguous or underspecified** in the story — acceptance criteria that seem to
  contradict `requirements.md`, missing detail on edge cases, or scope that seems bigger than a
  single story. Ask about these now, before the confirmation step, if they'd change what "done"
  means.
- Check `requirements.md` and `PROGRESS.md`'s "Key design decisions already made" section for
  anything relevant to the feature (autosave, theming, filtering, DB-path, PyInstaller bundling
  are the areas explicitly called out there) — flag it if the story looks like it conflicts with
  an existing decision, rather than silently overriding it.

## Step 3 — Confirm before starting (hard gate)

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get an explicit go-ahead. Something like:

- **Question**: "Ready to start implementing `<the resolved issue key>` as summarized above?"
  (use the actual key from step 1, e.g. `SCRUM-23` — never a hardcoded example key)
- **Options**: proceed as scoped / hold off (I want to change something first) / narrow or
  adjust the scope

Do not write, edit, or run anything beyond read-only exploration until the user confirms. If
they want changes to scope, update the summary and ask again — don't silently reinterpret.

## Step 4 — Branch setup

Once confirmed, before touching any files, set up an isolated branch for this story — never
implement directly on top of whatever branch happened to be checked out when the skill started.

1. **Resolve the base branch**: the git branch name supplied in the input (see Input section)
   if there was one, otherwise `main`.
2. **Import the base branch into the local repo** — it may only exist on `origin` (e.g. another
   session pushed it, or it was never checked out locally):
   - `git fetch origin <base-branch>`
   - If `<base-branch>` has no local ref yet, create one tracking the remote:
     `git checkout -b <base-branch> origin/<base-branch>`.
   - If it already exists locally, fast-forward it instead of recreating it:
     `git checkout <base-branch> && git pull --ff-only origin <base-branch>`.
   - If the fetch fails because the branch doesn't exist on `origin` either, stop and tell the
     user — don't silently fall back to `main` without asking, since they explicitly named a
     different base.
3. **Check for uncommitted local changes** (`git status --porcelain`) before switching anything.
   If there are changes unrelated to this story, stop and ask how to handle them (stash, commit,
   discard) rather than dragging them onto the new branch unasked.
4. **Create the feature branch** off the now-local base branch, following this repo's existing
   `feature/<slug>` naming convention (see `feature/logging`, `feature/working-app-V2`):
   `git checkout -b feature/<issue-key-lowercased>[-<short-kebab-slug>] <base-branch>`
   (e.g. `feature/scrum-23-dark-mode-toggle`), using the issue key from Step 1 so the branch is
   traceable back to the ticket.
   - If a branch with that name already exists locally, ask the user whether to reuse it (e.g.
     resuming earlier work on the same story) or pick a different name — don't force-overwrite
     silently.

All implementation work from Step 5 onward happens on this new branch.

## Step 5 — Implement

Once the branch is set up, implement the change following this repo's rules from `CLAUDE.md`:

- Respect the strict layering (`app/ui/` and `app/controllers/` never import `sqlite3`;
  `app/repositories/` and `app/models/` never import `PySide6`; no networking modules anywhere in
  `app/`). `tests/test_architecture_boundaries.py` enforces this at build time, so a violation
  isn't just style — it fails the suite.
- Keep the change scoped to what was confirmed in step 3. If while implementing you discover the
  story needs more than expected (e.g. a schema/migration change nobody flagged), stop and check
  with the user rather than expanding scope unilaterally.
- Follow existing patterns in the touched files rather than introducing a new style — this
  codebase has consistent conventions per layer (dataclasses + `from_row()` in `app/models/`, one
  repository method per table-ish concern, controller-mediated writes, etc.).

## Step 6 — Unit testing

Once the change is implemented:

1. Write or extend tests under `tests/` matching the existing conventions for the layer touched
   (plain `conn`-fixture tests for repositories, `qtbot`-driven tests under `tests/ui/` for
   widgets — see the "Testing conventions" section of `CLAUDE.md`, including the notes on
   `QTest.qWait` for debounce/polling timers and driving real widgets instead of calling
   controller methods directly).
2. Run the full suite: `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest`. Don't stop at "the new test passes" —
   a layering or autosave change can break unrelated tests.
3. If anything fails, fix it and rerun until the suite is green. Report the actual pass/fail
   counts — don't claim success without having run it.

## Step 7 — Code commit, push the code to git hub

Only after Step 6's test suite is green:

1. Review scope before staging: `git status` / `git diff` to confirm everything staged actually
   belongs to this story. `git add` the touched files (or `git add -A` only if the whole diff is
   in-scope) — don't sweep in unrelated stray changes.
2. Commit with a message following this repo's existing convention (see `git log`, e.g.
   `Added feature # SCRUM-8 - font family to the text editor`):
   `<Verb> feature # <issue-key> - <short plain-language description>`, using the real issue key
   from Step 1. End the commit message with:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
3. Push the feature branch created in Step 4 to `origin`, never `main` directly:
   `git push -u origin <feature-branch>` on the first push (plain `git push` after that, since
   `-u` already set the upstream).
4. If the push is rejected (e.g. the remote has diverged), stop and ask the user how to proceed —
   don't force-push without being explicitly told to.
5. Report the branch name pushed and confirm success from the actual `git push` output — don't
   claim it pushed without having run it. Opening a pull request is optional and belongs in Step 9
   (wrap-up) as something to offer, not do unasked.

## Step 8 — Update the Jira ticket

Once the feature branch is pushed, close the loop on the ticket itself — do this automatically as
part of finishing the story, not as something to offer/ask permission for (unlike opening a PR in
Step 9):

1. Post a summary comment on the issue via `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue` covering what
   changed (files touched), how it maps back to the story's acceptance criteria, the test result
   (counts, not just "tests pass"), and the feature branch name — the same level of detail you'd
   give the user in Step 9's wrap-up.
2. Transition the issue via `mcp__atlassian__getTransitionsForJiraIssue` +
   `mcp__atlassian__transitionJiraIssue` to whichever returned transition's target status is named
   **"In Review"** — look it up rather than hardcoding a transition ID, since IDs can differ across
   projects/workflows.

## Step 9 — Wrap up

- Summarize what changed: files touched, and a one-line mapping back to the story's acceptance
  criteria (does each point from the ticket have a corresponding change?).
- Report the final test run result verbatim (counts, not just "tests pass").
- `PROGRESS.md`/`tasklist.md` and `README` get updated per *phase*, not per individual task/story — don't
  update them reflexively here. If this story completes a phase of work, ask the user whether
  they want those docs updated now.
- Optionally offer (don't do it unasked) to open a pull request from the pushed feature branch
  (e.g. via `gh pr create`) targeting the base branch resolved in Step 4.
